# Project Details

## Short rundown
A webserver that runs on a Raspberry Pi computer.

The Raspberry Pi computer has General-purpose Input/Output (gpio) pins which are controlled via WebSockets.

WebSockets that are received tell the Raspberry Pi are used to determine the action taken, typically sending RF signal.

## Ideas
### IR transmitter 
Replace your remote controls with this module.

May have to point at the target device, therefore motion may be needed.  [This is one solution](http://www.robotshop.com/en/dagu-mini-pan-and-tilt-kit.html)
